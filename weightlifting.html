    <p>
Weightlifting is the sport or activity of lifting bar bells and other heavy weights. It's mainly used for building muscle and strength. Although weightlifting is for both women and men, women tend to do more cardio than weightlifting. This is due to the fact that the society thinks that muscles are only for men and not for women. Muscle mass is what provides a women with a fit and lean shape especially when combined with a healthy prudent meal plan. The main reason why women do not lift weights is that they think they will be too muscular and look like a guy. But this is not the truth. The truth is women can't build big and bulky muscle mass like men due to the lack of testestrone in their body. When women build muscle their muscle are usually strong and lean giving them the best posture and shape that all women dream of. <br><br>
There are some women especially on Ms.olympia body builders competition whose bodies have the body of a male body builder. And the reason is because they take steroids. Steroid is one of the large group of chemical substances classified by a specific carbon structure. Steroids include drugs used to relieve swelling and inflammation, such as prednisone and cortisone; vitamin D, and some sex hormones such as testestrone and estradiol. 
Women who use anabolic steroids encounter musculinizing side effects like deep voice, increased facial hair, smaller breasts and absence of menstruation cycle.
