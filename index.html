            <h2>What is Fitness</h2>
                <br>
    <p>
    Fitness is a condition of being physically fit and healthy and involves attributes that include, but are not limited to mental acuity, cardiorespiratory indurance, muscular strength, musclar endurance, body composition and flexibility. Physical activity or exercise can improve your health and reduce the risk of developing several diseases. Infact doing physical exercises regularly have tons of health benefits. Some of the health benefits are reduce heart attack, lower blood cholesterol level, manage your weight better (can help you to stay in shape), feel better (more energitic). Although the health benefits are for both gender, men take more advantage of it than women do. 
        </p>
    <h2>Why don't women workout?</h2>
    <p>
    Ever since early ages women have been held in doing the house work, taking care of families before themselves, and generally neglecting themselves. These has led women to forget about themselves specially in developing and less developed countries. Africa is one of the continents with most suppressed women. These factors cause women in Africa not to engage in physical activities or anything outside that made them participate in public. But as of 21st century, things have started to change. Women have been participating more and more in relating to everything starting from getting employed to becoming political leaders. Eventhough gender equality has started being practiced, we haven't seen a satisfying change in the fitness sector. The main factor for not getting a satisfying change is that women are discouraged when it comes to exercising.
    </p>
    <h2>Why do society discourage women?</h2>
    <p>
    There are some reasons why women are discouraged by the society. These reasons are the result of backward thinking that has been with us in the early centuries. The main reason is the statement that says "if women workout they are gonna look like men (muscular as men)", which is false. And also the society made some myths about women and fitness
