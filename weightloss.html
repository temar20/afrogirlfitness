            <h2>Weight loss</h2>
    <p>
     
Weight loss is a decrease of weight that may be intentional or unintentional. But now we are going to talk about the intentional way of losing weight. Research has shown that weight loss journey is easier for men than women that is because due to the fact that women burn less calorie than men while functioning normal body functions like breathing, thinking, and calculating. In order to have an intentional weight loss we need to follow a certain procedure like the diet, the kind of exercise we need to do, and how much time we should rest. Weight loss is a long-term plan which needs a lot of patience and dedication. There are some misunderstandings when it comes to weight loss these are :-<br>
                </p>
1. Is that fat turns into muscle :- Fat and muscles are two different tissue and one can not be converted into the other. The best analogy we can use is that we can not turn an orange into an apple. People started believing in this myth because while someone is trying to build a muscle the exercises makes them lose fat.<br><br>
2. Is targeted fat loss which is a belief that says we can target a certain part of our body to lose weight :- your body burns fat based on overall fitness, not small muscle fatigue. <br><br>
3. Is losing fat with just cardio exercise :- Eventhough cardio exercises are the main exercises to burn fat it doesn't mean we shouldn't do other exercises and follow diet plans. <br><br>
4. Carbs can make you fat :- eventhough eating more protein and less fat can accelerate fat loss it doesn't mean that eating carbs will make you fat, in fact carbs are one of the most healthy nutrition.<br><br>
5. Fast food is always fattening :- not all fast food is unhealthy. Because of people's increased health conciousness many fast food chains have started offering healthier options. Some, such as Chipotle, even focus exclusively on serving healthy foods.<br><br>
